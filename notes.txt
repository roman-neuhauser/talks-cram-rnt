====

* "  $ " lines are run in the shell.

* "  > " lines allow multi-line commands.

* All other lines beginning with two spaces are command output.

* Output lines *ending* with " (re)" are matched as Perl-compatible regexps.

* Lines ending with " (glob)" are matched with a glob-like syntax.
  The only special characters supported are * and ?.
  Both characters can be escaped using \, and the backslash can be
  escaped itself.

* Output lines ending with either of the above keywords are always
  first matched literally with actual command output.

* Lines ending with " (no-eol)" will match actual output that doesn't
  end in a newline.

* Actual output lines containing unprintable characters are escaped
  and suffixed with " (esc)". Lines matching unprintable output must
  also contain the keyword.

* Anything else is a comment.

* test files use the .t file extension.
